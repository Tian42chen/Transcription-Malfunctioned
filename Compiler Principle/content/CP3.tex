\section{Parsing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lexical Analysis: Create sequence of tokens from characters
    \item Parsing: Create abstract syntax tree from sequence of tokens
\end{itemize}

Syntax: the way in which words are put together to form phrases, clauses, or sentences

\subsection{Context-free Grammars}
\subsubsection{Definition for CFG}
计算理论 IV.1.

\subsubsection{Derivations}
计算理论 IV.2-3

用 CFG 生成 string

\subsubsection{Parse Trees}
计算理论 IV.5

Representing derivations as a tree. Parse trees have meaning. 

\subsubsection{Ambiguous Grammars}
A grammar is ambiguous if the same sequence of tokens can give rise to two or more parse trees.

Eliminating ambiguity by transforming the grammar.

However, there are some languages (sets of strings) that have ambiguous grammars but no unambiguous grammar.

\subsubsection{End-Of-File Marker}
Use \$ to represent end of file
