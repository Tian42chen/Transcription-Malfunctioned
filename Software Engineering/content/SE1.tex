\section{The Nature of Software}
\subsection{Defining Software}
Software is: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item instructions (computer programs) that when executed provide desired features, function, and performance; 
    \item data structures that enable the programs to adequately manipulate information; 
    \item documents that describes the operation and use of the programs.
\end{enumerate}

Science 是解释,  Engineering 是创造.

\subsubsection{The Difficulties of Engineering Software}
软件不会磨损, 但环境改变, 其需求也要改变.

软件的本质是要支持需求的改变.
